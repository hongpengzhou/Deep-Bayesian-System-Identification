Each folder includes an MLP and LSTM main file to run from the terminal as follows for MLP

python .\MLP_DRY_main.py 5 5 1 1 2 

or for LSTM 

python .\LSTM_DRY_main.py 5 5 1 1 2 

and results are saved in each folder of the benchmark seperatly. The inputs to this main function are better described in the main function. 

These functions import the network model, lib and bayesian algorithm, one step up in the hierarchy of the folder.
